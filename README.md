## 🔥 Hackathon Firebusters 2025

Hello! 👋 This project was born during the exciting "Hackathon Firebusters" held on February 22-23, 2025. In just 48 hours of intense coding, coffee ☕ and dedication, our team managed to create a partially functional prototype of an application aimed at saving lives.

## 💡 The Problem and Our Solution

In the Bolivian Amazon, forest fires are a constant threat that endangers not only our precious ecosystems but also the lives of the brave firefighters who combat them. FireTeam was created as a solution to protect those who protect us.

### How does it work? 🤔

FireTeam is a mobile app specifically designed for firefighting teams that:

- 🚨 Sends automatic early alerts if a team member disconnects from the hotspot network
- 🆘 Allows sending manual alerts in case of emergency
- 📡 Monitors WiFi connection quality of each member in real-time
- 🔄 Works without internet, using local hotspot networks

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- 📱 **React Native** with **Expo** as the main framework
- 🌐 P2P system over local network using `react-native-udp`
- 🔔 Notifications with `expo-notifications`
- 📡 Network monitoring with `@react-native-community/netinfo` and `expo-network`
- 🎯 TypeScript for safer and maintainable code
- 💅 Modern and responsive UI with native components

## 🚀 Installation and Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone [repository URL]
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. Start the application:
   ```bash
   pnpm start
   ```
